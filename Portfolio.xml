		<title> Work Experience </title>
		<p> Currently, I am employed by Northeastern as a Computer Lab Technician and as a College of Computer Science Tutor. I also have experience in Quality Assurance from an internship at Euromoney Institutional Investor. Although Northeastern is a Co-op school, i have yet to have one because of my Dual Major. The anticipated date of said Co-op is Spring 2015</p>
