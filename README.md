website
=======
My goal is to create a portfolio website where I can put everything i've created

TO DOS
Make the nav bar better looking, maybe add shaders so it's not just a boring solid color
Fix background of the about section
finish js in experience section where you hover over the skill icons and the computer changes
Make the contact section be more concise, less information maybe just all icons
Make the backgrounds of each section flow more, maybe by adding dividers to tie everything together
pick fonts for the sections
upload more art pieces and show it a little better maybe with css transitions
